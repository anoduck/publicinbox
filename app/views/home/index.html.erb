  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Having public conversations that don't fit into 140-character nuggets</h3>

    <p>
      We've all seen our share of "debates" on Twitter. I put "debates" in quotes because even the
      most level-headed and rational people are awfully constrained to fit the nuances of their
      arguments into 140-character tweets, or even streams of many tweets. Jeff Atwood wrote a while
      back about <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/on-escalating-communication/">recognizing when
      it's time to switch from Twitter to e-mail</a> for serious conversations, and when it's time to
      have a 1-on-1 conversation. But "escalating" the debate in this manner unfortunately also makes
      it private.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes we <em>want</em>&mdash;or anyway, I do!&mdash;to see these conversations
      unfold. Especially when they're between people we respect, and we want to understand both points
      of view.

    <h3>Turn-based debates</h3>

    <p>
      Just like people sometimes get into debates on Twitter when a longer format would really be
      more appropriate, there are times when people have actual debates&mdash;like, organized,
      competitive events&mdash;to discuss issues that deserve more careful deliberation. The real-
      time nature of these events, along with the fact that there are game-like elements thrown in
      (rules like time limits, the declaration of a "winner"), can often distract from the core
      ideas being considered.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also think you'll just get better, more thought-out arguments through e-mail. Even skilled
      debaters likely can't articulate their argument perfectly on the spot all the time in just a
      few minutes. And if/when they want to provide references to studies, statistics, or other
      material, doing so in an e-mail is as easy as providing a link. In live debates, far too often
      such references are tossed out as a rhetorical tactic with the expectation that nobody in the
      audience will bother digging into the research later.

    <h3>Interacting publicly with fans, readers, users, etc.</h3>

    <p>
      Say you're an artist, musician, whatever, and you want to engage with your fans. There's really
      nothing quite like the personal touch of an e-mail. With public e-mail you could provide that
      personal touch but still be able to share it with your fanbase at large. The same goes for
      bloggers, reporters, or others who would be interested in having one-to-one communication with
      their audience that can be shared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personally, I could even see a use for this as a developer active in the open source community.
      If a user writes to me with a question, I want to respond directly to help him or her. But I
      <em>also</em> want to
      <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/maximizing-the-value-of-your-keystrokes/">maximize the
      value of my keystrokes</a>. Responding directly and then sharing my e-mail seems like a great
      way to do that.

    <h3>Open letters</h3>

    <p>
      You know how sometimes people write <em>open letters</em>? Maybe it's a government official,
      maybe a corporate executive, maybe a celebrity. Whoever it is, though, an open letter is
      really quite an indirect way to reach them. Often these are featured in magazines or online
      publications, and the recipient is presumably expected to just <em>hear</em> about it. There's
      very little pressure to respond.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of all that, how about <em>actually e-mailing the person</em>, and then publishing your
      e-mail? This is more direct, and it also has the added benefit that if the recipient ever
      responds, that will also be public! So in this way an open letter could even turn into a
      meaningful dialogue.
    </p>

    <h3>Uses I haven't even thought of</h3>

    <p>
      These are just a few ideas. I bet there are other ways people could find a public e-mail account
      useful. So go on: <a href="/register">create an account</a> and see for yourself!
